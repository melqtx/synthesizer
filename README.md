## "Allows you to simply listen to that waveform!" - @Javidx9

The main library was developed by [Javed](https://youtu.be/tgamhuQnOkM), but written for Windows. I tweaked it a little to work on Linux.

You can now listen to waveforms, in current iteration this works like a piano for home row, this will grow with time.
